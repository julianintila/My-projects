            <h5>Attack On Titan</h5>
            <p>When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, humans found safety behind massive walls that
              stopped the giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had for so long is threatened when a colossal
              Titan smashes through the barriers, causing a flood of the giants into what had been the humans' safe
              zone. During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures devour his mother,
              which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists some friends who survived to help him,
              and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction at the hands of the monsters.</p>

            <h5>Tokyo Revengers</h5>
            <p>Takemichi Hanagaki, a worthless part-time worker, learns that his ex-girlfriend from middle school,
              Hinata Tachibana has been killed in a tussle between the Tokyo Manji Gang. Takemichi is shocked by the
              news and is standing on the train station then someone pushes him on the railroad tracks.

              But before the train hits him he remembers Hinata and he awakens in the train and sees his old school
              friends Akkun, Yamagishi, Makoto, and Takuya calling him. He sees himself in a mirror and realizes that he
              has the same look during middle school. He checks his phone and sees that itâ€™s July 4th, 2005, which is
              exactly 12 years ago.</p>
